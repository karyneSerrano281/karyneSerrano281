👋 Hi! I'm Karyne, a highly motivated Systems Engineering student with a strong interest in technology, research, and continuous learning.

💻 I enjoy working on software development projects, especially in **mobile development**, **user-friendly interfaces**, and **problem-solving through code**. I like building clean, functional, and visually appealing applications.

🤖 I'm deeply interested in **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis**, and my long-term goal is to pursue a **Master’s and PhD in Artificial Intelligence**, contributing to research and real-world solutions.

📚 Currently, I’m strengthening my skills in:
- Programming fundamentals and software engineering
- Mobile development (Flutter)
- Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)
- Python and data-related tools
- AI and machine learning concepts

🌱 I believe in learning by doing, so you’ll find academic projects, experiments, and personal initiatives here as I grow as a developer and researcher.

📫 Feel free to connect or collaborate!
